# Question
An Electric vehicle dealership want to establish a dealership in the united states. Gather data and prepare analysis and visualisations as to which state will the
dealership thrive to be succesful

# Analysis - refer to file "Module 7 - Project 1 - Group 7 Presentation.pptx"

Within our analysis, we will investigate:
Top 5 states - government estimated EV infrastructure funding and funding per capita 2022-2026
Top 5 states - ev registrations are highest and average registrations per capita
Top 5 states - year on year growth percentage in EV registrations over the years 2019-2020
Top 5 states - number of EV charging outlets and number of charging outlets per capita

# Visualisations - refer to "Output_Data" Folder
bar graphs for estimated funding of ev infrastructure including hv plot for all states
bar graphs for the trend of ev registations over the years
bar graph for the trend of charging outlets over the years
scatter plots of ev sales vs average fuel price and show corealltaion
scatter plots of ev sales vs charging ports and show corellation
geopaify hvplots for the states with size = total ev sales
geoapify hvplots for the states with size = yoy growth percentage.
